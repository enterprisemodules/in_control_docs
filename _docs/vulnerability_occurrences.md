The "Vulnerabilities -> Occurrences" page is an important feature that allows users to easily view all detected vulnerabilities across all nodes. Users can navigate the page by selecting the corresponding tab, which displays vulnerabilities of a specific severity. In addition to the default "All" tab, several other tabs are available, including "Critical," "High," "Medium," "Low," and "Skipped." This feature allows users to filter and view vulnerabilities based on their severity, which is particularly useful for those who need to focus on specific vulnerabilities or who want to get an overview of the severity of vulnerabilities across all nodes. Overall, the "Vulnerabilities -> Occurrences" section provides a comprehensive view of all detected vulnerabilities, making it an essential tool for any user looking to improve their system's security.

### Search field

When using CVE to search for vulnerabilities, there are several different ways you can approach the search. One way is to search by the node name, which can help you to identify vulnerabilities that are specific to certain components or areas of your system. Additionally, you can search by environment, which can help you to identify vulnerabilities that are specific to certain operating systems or platforms. Finally, you can search by description of the CVE, which can help you to identify vulnerabilities based on the types of issues they are known to cause. By using these different search methods, you can more effectively identify potential vulnerabilities and take proactive steps to address them before they can be exploited by attackers.
