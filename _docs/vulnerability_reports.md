## Report statistics

At the top of the InControl page, detailed statistics are displayed to provide you with an overview of your vulnerabilities. These statistics provide information on the number of critical, high, medium, low and skipped vulnerabilities. For each severity, InControl will show you the current and previous numbers of vulnerabilities with that severity. Moreover, if there is a change between the current and previous numbers, InControl will display the difference as an absolute number and as a percentage, so that you can see at a glance how your vulnerabilities have been progressing. The color of the indicator will also inform you whether it is an improvement or a decline. Green indicates an improvement, and red indicates a decline. Therefore, these statistics are incredibly useful for monitoring the progress of your vulnerabilities and identifying areas for improvement.

## Report change log

While the statistics at the top of the page provide a useful overview, it is important to delve deeper into the data to gain a full understanding of the changes that have occurred. InControl recognizes this need and offers a change log to help users identify the differences between the previous and current reports.

The change log displays a detailed account of what vulnerabilities of what severity have identified, or have been fixed on your systems. Allowing users to gain a comprehensive understanding of the changes that have occurred. By using the change log, you can quickly identify areas that require attention and address them before they become problematic.

Moreover, the log provides a complete history of changes made to the vulnerability state, which can be extremely useful for tracking and auditing purposes. It ensures that all changes made to the vulnerability state are recorded accurately, enabling users to easily review and approve them.

In addition to the default "All" tab, several other tabs are available, including "Critical," "High," "Medium," "Low," and "Skipped." This feature allows users to filter and view vulnerabilities based on their severity, which is particularly useful for those who need to focus on specific vulnerabilities or who want to get an overview of the severity of vulnerabilities across all nodes. 


| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Vulnerability| This column shows the CVE number or another identifying number for the detected vulnerability. Clicking on it takes you to the [Vulnerability details page](/docs/in_control/vulnerability_details.html)|
| Description| This column provides a brief description of the vulnerability. If the column is empty, no short description is provided by the sources.|
| Severity| This column displays the severity of the detected vulnerability.|
