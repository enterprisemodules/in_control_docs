As the responsible party for ensuring compliance within your systems, databases, and cloud environments, it is crucial to have visibility into the current compliance status of your IT infrastructure. Unfortunately, without any means to do so, you lack the ability to determine if your infrastructure is configured in accordance with the required (CIS) controls. Additionally, without any tools to fix security issues, you are unable to address non-compliance when it is detected.

## Single Point of Compliance Information

InControl is an application designed to make it easy to visualize the current compliance and vulnerability status of your entire IT infrastructure. Whether it's the CIS compliance of your operating system, databases, or Cloud environment, InControl is the central application to assess CIS compliance.

## Enforce compliance too

Reporting is useful, but the ultimate goal is to ensure that your IT infrastructure is compliant and free of critical vulnerabilities. InControl, in combination with our security modules for Linux, Windows, Oracle, DB2, Postgres, and MS SQL server, allows you to enforce selected compliance controls on your IT infrastructure, not just once but continuously. This ensures that your IT infrastructure remains compliant, free of critical vulnerabilities, and secure at all times.

## Fixing what is important

InControl provides organisations with a list of top priorities based on its comprehensive knowledge of the compliance and vulnerabilities of their entire IT infrastructure. This enables them to focus on what is truly important.

## A picture says moreâ€¦.

It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words - this adage is particularly true when it comes to visualizing complex data. InControl recognizes the importance of providing clear, concise information about the compliance and vulnerability status of your IT infrastructure.  So, when it comes to visualizing the compliance and vulnerability status of your IT infrastructure, InControl understands that a picture is worth a thousand words. That's why we use graphs to report back to you in a clear, concise and actionable way.

That's why we use graphs to present this information in a way that is easy to understand and act on.

As the party responsible for ensuring compliance within your systems, databases, and cloud environments, it is crucial to have visibility into the current compliance status of your IT infrastructure. Without the right tools, you may find yourself unable to determine whether your infrastructure is configured in accordance with the required CIS controls. Additionally, without any means of fixing security issues, you will be unable to address non-compliance when it is detected.

## Easy adaptable, easy maintainable

Our security modules for Linux, Windows, Oracle, DB2, Postgres, and MS SQL Server are designed with CIS compliance standards in mind. These modules implement 95% of all controls that can be automated based on those standards. If there is any deviation from one of these controls, it is automatically reported. You can then choose whether to have InControl fix the deviation or skip it if the control is not relevant to your infrastructure.

We make sure that new versions of the CIS benchmarks are added to our security modules. With InControl, you have the option to use the most recent versions of the controls or update to the latest, most secure versions at your discretion.

## Auditable

Your auditor would like to know the changes made to your security measures and the reasons behind them. InControl keeps a detailed record of not only the steps taken to establish your compliance monitoring but also alterations made to your compliance and any vulnerabilities detected.
