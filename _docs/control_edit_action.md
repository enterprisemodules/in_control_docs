This form allows you to modify the action for a compliance control on one or more nodes.

![Control Edit action](/in_control_docs/docs/images/control-edit-action.jpg)

At the top of the modal, you will see the selected control. Just below the control's name, you can view the labels of the nodes you have selected. Each label's color indicates the state of the compliance control on that node. In this example, we have selected a control that passes on two nodes.

## Reason for Change

When making any changes, it is important to provide a reason or rationale. The change and its rationale are recorded in the [audit trail](/docs/in_control/audit_trail.html). Be sure to specify the reason **why** the change was made, rather than just the **what** was changed. If applicable, it is recommended to reference any company standards that require the selected control to be activated or skipped.
